# Where to stay?![](/assets/StayEthCC.jpg)

If you're planning on staying in Paris for more than three days, you'll probably turn to **Airbnb** rather than looking for a hotel. This is a wise decision, particularly when you consider how overpriced Parisian hotels are and that early spring is already tourist season.

#### If you plan on booking an hotel, [BTU-Hotel to offer you special offers on room](http://btu-hotel.com/) \(mention EthCC in the search bar\)

The best neighborhood \(cheapest\) to head to is probably Charonne, especially if you're with a partner. It's one of the few areas that's both clean and located in Eastern Paris, which is where you want to be to find bars open after 7 PM and streets frequented by locals.

If you really must stay in a hotel, [**les Piaules**](http://lefooding.com/en/bedrooms-hotels/hotel-les-piaules-paris-2\) is both very cheap and close to the venue.

For a more expensive and comfy experience we suggest [**Le Citizen**](http://lefooding.com/en/chambres-hotels\ )** **hotel or basically anything you can find on booking.com
