  [**ASSETH**](https://www.asseth.fr/en/home/) organizes EthCC with the support of the Ethereum Foundation and the CNAM.  
  Asseth is a regulated French non-profit organization. It hosts free Ethereum workshops several times a month since early 2016, feeds [the Ethereum France website](https://www.ethereum-france.com/) and translates technical papers in French. Asseth also participates to various educational projects and [open-source projects](https://github.com/asset/).  
  We initiated the [France Blockchain Week](https://blockchainweek.fr/) but it is organized by the French crypto community.

* A huge thanks to the past [Sponsors ](/sponsors.md)of EthCC who made this event a reality.
