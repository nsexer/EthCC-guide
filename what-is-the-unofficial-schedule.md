## Try Kickback to manage your free events

Are you hosting a free event? Then consider managinging your event using [Kickback](http://kickback.events). Kickback is an Ethereum-based event management service that asks registrants to commit some ETH. If they don't come, ETH will be shared among attendees, preventing no shows while rewarding attendees.

Kickback has been tried at [various side events during DevCon4](https://medium.com/wearekickback/kickback-at-devcon4-part-1-by-the-numbers-c68608acbbc) , [GÃ¶rliCon](https://kickback.events/event/0xe2d2c31c68626b6c1301a49ed50854e1cae0c8fa) and [other local Ethereum meetups](https://medium.com/wearekickback/kickback-is-coming-to-your-town-befaf8dd58a9).

Please read [the event organiser guide](https://medium.com/wearekickback/kickback-event-organiser-guide-c2146c12defb), and request [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2RX1yCpGomlG8JI0GiNuUFdWZIyLvCa4YM5VNR7Md4hkqWQ/viewform) if you are interested.
